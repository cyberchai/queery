<h2>Mini Search Engine using SVD-Based Query Matching</h2>

This project implements a basic search engine to demonstrate key concepts in computational linear algebra, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
Given a set of PDF documents and a user-defined vocabulary, the code constructs a term-document frequency matrix and uses SVD to perform dimensionality reduction.
When a user submits a query, it is projected into the same reduced space, and cosine similarity is used to identify and rank the most relevant documents.
The project highlights how SVD can be applied to approximate large matrices, extract latent semantic structures, and improve search precision by reducing noise.
These are methods in information retrieval and natural language processing.
